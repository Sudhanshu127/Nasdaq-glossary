Alpha
Measure of risk-adjusted performance.   Some refer to the alpha as the difference between the investment return and the benchmark return. However, this does not properly adjust for risk. More appropriately, an alpha  is generated by regressing the security or mutual fund's excess return on the benchmark (for example S&P 500) excess return.  The beta adjusts for the risk (the slope coefficient).  The alpha is the intercept.  Example: Suppose the mutual fund has a return of 25%, and the short-term interest rate is 5% (excess return is 20%).  During the same time the market excess return is 9%.  Suppose the beta of the mutual fund is 2.0 (twice as risky as the S&P 500).  The expected excess return given the risk is 2 x 9%=18%.  The actual excess return is 20%.  Hence, the alpha is 2% or 200 basis points.  Alpha is also known as the Jensen Index.  The alpha depends on the benchmark used. For example, it may be the intercept in a multifactor model that includes risk factors in addition to the S&P 500. Related: Risk-adjusted return.

--------------------------------------

Alpha equation
Regression usually run over 36-60 months of data: Return-Treasury bill= alpha + beta (S&P 500 - Treasury bill) + error.  The alpha is the intercept.  Note that the benchmark does not necessarily have to be the S&P 500.  A mutual fund specializing in international investment might be benchmarked to a broader world market index, such as the MSCI World Index.

An example is a combination buy limit/ buy stop order, where the buy limit is below the current market and the buy stop is above.  If the order is for one unit of trading, when one part of the order is executed on the occurrence of one alternative, the order on the other alternative is to be treated as cancelled.  If the order is for an amount of more than one unit of trading, the number of units executed determines the amount of the alternative order to be treated as cancelled.  Sometimes known as One Cancels the Other. Also see: Either-or order.

Arms index
Also known as a TRading INdex (TRIN). The index

Basel I
Agreement concluded among country representatives in 1988 in Basel, Switzerland to develop standardized risk-based capital requirements for banks across countries. The Accord is also known as 1988 Basel Accord and it primarily focused on credit risk and is now viewed as outdated. Basel II is currently in the process of implementation and Basel III is currently under development.

--------------------------------------

Basel II
An update of Basel I, Basel II was published in June 2004. The revised accord aimed to improve the consistency of capital regulations internationally, make regulatory capital more risk sensitive, and promote enhanced risk-management practices among large, internationally active banking organizations. Generally speaking, with Basel II, the greater risk to which the bank is exposed, the greater the amount of capital the bank needs to hold. However, critics of Basel II say that the revised accord failed to regulate certain risk transfers, such as securitization or transfer of risk to unregulated parts of holding companies.

--------------------------------------

Basel III
Describes the third version of the Basel Accords agreed upon by 27 countries on September 12, 2010. Among the highlights was the increasing of Tier 1 capital from 2% to 4.5% and the addition of a buffer of 2.5%. The assets that qualify for capital were also redefined. The full implementation of the accord is not due until 2023.

Beta
The measure of an asset's risk in relation to the market (for example, the S&P500) or to an alternative benchmark or factors. Roughly speaking, a security with a beta of 1.5, will have move, on average, 1.5 times the market return. [More precisely, that stock's excess return (over and above a short-term money market rate) is expected to move 1.5 times the market excess return).] According to asset pricing theory, beta represents the type of risk, systematic risk, that cannot be diversified away. When using beta, there are a number of issues that you need to be aware of: (1) betas may change through time; (2) betas may be different depending on the direction of the market (i.e. betas may be greater for down moves in the market rather than up moves); (3) the estimated beta will be biased if the security does not frequently trade; (4) the beta is not necessarily a complete measure of risk (you may need multiple betas). Also, note that the beta is a measure of co-movement, not volatility. It is possible for a security to have a zero beta and higher volatility than the market.

--------------------------------------

Beta equation (security)
The market beta of a security is determined as follows: Regress excess returns of stock y on excess returns of the market. The slope coefficient is beta. Define n as number of observation numbers. Beta=
[(n) (sum of [xy]) ]-[ (sum of x) (sum of y)]/ 
[(n) (sum of [xx]) ]-[ (sum of x) (sum of x)] 
where: n = # of observations (usually 36 to 60 months) 
x = rate of return for the S&P 500 index 
y = rate of return for the security.

Blockchain
Think of blockchain as a database or a spreadsheet. But a really special spreadsheet. There's no centralized master copy. Instead, it's shared on many computers. It's special because you can only add to it. There's no editing of history. The database is divided into chronological sub-sheets. These are the blocks. The last line of any block summarizes all of the data in the block, and — and this is pretty important — appears as the first line of the next block. If anyone tries to edit a block, the last line will change and will not match the first line of the next block. The network sees this corrupted block and immediately replaces it. This ingenious trick makes it futile to rewrite history and guarantees an unprecedented degree of security. Blockchain was invented by Haber and Stornetta in 1991 but made famous in the Satoshi Nakamoto's bitcoin paper.

--------------------------------------

Carry Trade
For the bond market, this refers to a trade where you borrow and pay interest in order to buy something else that has higher interest. For example, with a positively sloped term structure (short rates lower than long rates), one might borrow at low short term rates and finance the purchase of long-term bonds. The carry return is the coupon on the bonds minus the interest costs of the short-term borrowing. Of course, if long-term interest rates unexpectedly rose(and long-term bond prices fell as a result), the carry trade could become unprofitable. Indeed, if this occured, there could be a number of investors trying to unwind the carry trade, which would involve selling the long-term bonds. It is possible that this could exacerbate the increase in long-term interest rates, i.e. push the rates even higher. For currency, you buy the currency that has the highest local short term interest rate. For more information on currency, see: Currency Carry Trade.

Annual return calculated based on each year's previous balances where each previous balance includes both the original principal and all interest accrued from prior years. Best defined by example. If you invest $100 today and make 5%
in the first year and reinvest ($105) and make 8% in the second
year, the compound annual growth rate is 6.489%. The calculation
is $100x1.05x1.08=$113.4 which is what you end up with at the end
of year two. The average return is [square root(113.4/100) -1]=
0.06489 or 6.489%. Note 1. If we had three compounding periods we
would take the cubic root (power of 1/3). Note 2. If we had
invested at exactly 6.489 in both periods, we get
$100x1.06489x1.06489=$113.4. Note 3. The example is directed to a
return - but CAGR could be applied to earnings growth, GDP
growth, etc.

correlations (and volatility) are known to increase,
so what might appear to be excessive  correlations may not be contagion.

Also known as CFD. This is an agreement between buyer and seller to exchange the difference between the current value of the asset and the initial value of the asset when the contract is initiated. For example, suppose the initial price of share XYZ is $100 and a CFD for 1000 shares is exchanged. Both the buyer and seller must post some margin. If the price goes to $105, then the buyer gets $5,000 from the seller. If the price goes to $95, the buyer pays the seller $5,000. This contract avoids ownership of the stock and all the associated transactions issues (like stamp taxes). The contract also allows for leverage (typically 10:1) because the margin that must be posted is only a fraction of the value of the underlying asset. These contracts can also be on the difference of two assets' prices. They can also be on the difference of a single asset of different maturities (like a bond or futures contracts). CFDs are sometimes known as spread trading.

Contrarian
An investment style that leads one to buy assets that have
performed poorly and sell assets that have performed well. There
are two possible reasons this strategy might work. The first is a
mean-reversion argument; that is, if the asset has deviated from
its usual level, it should eventually return to that usual level.
The second reason has to do with overreaction. Investors might
have overreacted to bad news sending the asset price lower than
it should be.

Convex
Refers to a non-linear asset pricing relationship. See convexity.

--------------------------------------

Convexity
This concept is best described with respect to a bond. Consider a graph of the bonds price (y-axis) and the bond yield (x-axis). If this graph was a straight line (downward sloping), there would be no convexity. It would be a simple linear relationship between bond price and yield (yield up, price down). However, bonds are non-linear functions of yields partly because irrespective of their how high their yield is, they cannot have negative price. Hence, the bond price is not a straight line, but a curve that is upward (like a bowl). So, if rates increase, the simple linear straightline will tell you (incorrectly) that the bond price drops too much). Essentially, the convexity is the second derivative whereas the linear relationship is the first-derivative (of bond price with respect to yield). If the asset price drops less than predicted by the linear relationship, it is known to have positive convexity (commonly referred in the bond market simply as ‘convexity’).  However, if the asset price drops by more than predicted by the linear relationship, it is known to have negative convexity (rather than the common usage in mathematics of concavity). Convexity is also associated with options which (by definition) have non-linear payoffs.

--------------------------------------

Covered Interest Rate Parity
The principle that the yields
from interest-bearing foreign and domestic investments should be equal when the
currency market is used to predetermine the
domestic currency payoff from a foreign investment. For example, suppose interest on 90 U.K. Treasury bills is 4% but only 1% in U.S. When the U.S. investor tries to take advantage of the higher yield, they translate U.S. dollars to Sterling to buy the Treasury bill and then sell 90-days forward Sterling (so they can translate the principal and interest back to U.S. dollars). Covered Interest Parity ensures that the return to this transaction is 1%. If it was different, there would be arbritrage.

Use of an option in a
trading strategy in the underlying asset which is already owned.

--------------------------------------

Covered put
A put option position in which the option writer also is short the corresponding stock or has deposited, in a cash
account, cash or cash equivalents equal to the exercise price of the option. This limits the option writer's risk because money or stock is already set aside. In the event

Stale price
An old
price of the asset that does not reflect the most recent information.

--------------------------------------

Stale price arbitrage
For a number of assets, the most recent transaction price at 4PM ET does not fully reflect all available market information. One example is international equities that trade on exchanges that are located in different time zones and close 2-15 hours before U.S. markets. In addition, domestic small-capitalization equities and high-yield and convertible bonds often trade infrequently and have wide bid-ask spreads. This can cause the most recent transaction price to be much different from the price that one would see in a liquid market at 4 PM, even for assets that trade on exchanges that are open at that time.  Investors can take advantage of mutual funds that calculate their NAVs using stale closing prices by trading based on recent market movements. For example, if the U.S. market has risen since the close of overseas equity markets, investors can expect that overseas markets will open higher the following morning. Investors can buy a fund with a stale-price NAV for less than its current value, and they can likewise sell a fund for more than its current value on a day that the U.S. market has fallen. Similar opportunities exist when the values of infrequently or illiquidly-traded domestic assets have recently changed. With normal market arbitrage, as more traders learn where to buy an item at relatively low cost and where to sell it at relatively high value, market pressures from such traders tend to stabilize prices.  With stale price arbitrage, there is no corresponding pressure for market correction.  That is, a fund always pays the going market rate even if that fund has an agreement with its customers to only charge them the price from the prior day closing.  Accordingly, even if such agreements ultimately impact the prices of trades by the mutual funds, there is no impact on the price paid by the customer of the mutual fund.  In that sense, the stale price arbitrage opportunity can last as long as a mutual fund honors its stale price agreement with its customers. Also referred to as Net Asset Value Arbitrage or NAV Arbitrage.

--------------------------------------

Stop-loss order
An order to unwind a position when the price moves against you. This order is designed to limit losses or in some cases to lock in a certain level of profit. As soon as the price of the security hits the stop-loss price (or falls below), the order becomes a market order.  If you were short the asset, the stop-loss would trigger a purchase. Stop-losses are often disabled for after hours trading because prices are often quite variable and you could be executed at an unfavorable price. Stop losses are also usually calculated off the bid price (which is a measure of what people are actually willing to pay if the security is sold). Again, one needs to be careful because if there is lack of liquidity, the bid-ask spread could be large and you could be stopped out at an unfavorable price. Finally, some traders have rolling or trailing stop loss. As the price moves up the stop-loss is moved higher (say 20% below the current price).

The maximum loss that a strap can incur occurs when the equity price on the expiration date of the options is the same as the price on the date the options were purchased. In this case, the loss is equal to the sum the three-option set was purchased for. However, with any deviation in the price either up or down, the strategy recovers at least some of the cost of purchasing the options. See: Strip, Straddle

The value of a bond at maturity, typically its par value, or the value of an asset (or an entire firm) on some specified future valuation date. Usually, a perpetuity formula is used.

If the cash flow forecast for year 11 is 100, the firm's discount rate is 12%, and inflation is expected to be 2%, we use the formula V10 = CF11/(disc rate-inflation). Hence, the value is 100/(0.12 - 0.02) that is 1,000. This cash flow needs to be brought back to present value using the formula 1000/(1.12)10, which is 321.97.

Refers to investment trusts which are populated by corporate bonds. In October 2001, Morgan Stanley's Tradable Custodial Receipts (Tracers) was launched.

Lehman Brothers launched a similar product, Targeted Return Index Securities (Trains) in January 2002. Both contain investment grade bonds. If a bond falls out of the investment grade category, it is either liquidated from the trust or delivered to the investor. Both Tracers and Trains are 144a trust structures and are only available to qualified  buyers because they are considered private securities due to the trust structure.

--------------------------------------

Tracker Mortgage
A type of mortgage  for which the interest rate tracks Bank of England’s interest rate.

--------------------------------------

Tracking error
In an indexing strategy, the standard deviation of the difference between the performance of the benchmark and the replicating portfolio.

--------------------------------------

Tracking stock
Best defined with an example. Suppose Company A purchases a business from Company B and pays B with 1 million shares of A's stock. The agreement provides that B cannot sell the 1 million shares for 60 days, and also prohibits B from hedging by purchasing put options on A's shares or short-selling A's shares. B is worried that the market may fall in the next 60 days. B could hedge by purchasing put options or selling the futures on the S&P 500. However, it is possible that A's business is much more cyclical than the S&P 500. One solution to this problem is to find a tracking stock. This is a stock that has high correlation with A.  Let us
call it Company C. The solution is to sell short or buy protective put options on this tracking stock C. This protects B from fluctuations in the price of A's stock over the next 60 days. Because the degree of the protection is related to the correlation of A and C's stock, it is extremely unlikely that the protection is perfect.  Multidivisional firms have used a form of restructuring called tracking stock since 1984 to segment the performance of a particular division -- similar to a spin-off or carve-out, except that the parent firm does not relinquish control of the tracked division.  Previously, this was known as alphabet stock, but the technically correct name is tracking stock (e.g., EDS traded for years as a tracking stock of GM).
This is a way to reward managers for good divisional performance with an equity that is tied to their division-rather than potentially penalizing them compensation for bad performance in a division they have no control over.

--------------------------------------

Trade date

Trading Ahead
A New York Stock Exchange rule violation. Basically, in this situation the specialist puts their firm's interest ahead of the investor's interest. Consider an example. Suppose that the specialist simultaneously receives orders from two investors, one to sell 5,000 shares of XYZ and one to buy 5,000 shares of XYZ. Normally, these orders are matched. However, suppose that the specialist substitutes (matches) her own firm's 5,000 shares of XYZ. That is, the firm's own shares are sold instead of the order that came in previously. This disadvantages the buyer because
the very next transaction will be the order to sell 5,000 shares of XYZ (which will likely put downward pressure
on the price). Notice that the firm has bailed out of XYZ at a higher price than if the order was reversed (the specialist's firm selling afterwards). Trading ahead is part of what is known as negative obligation. Trading ahead should not be confused with
front-running.

Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities (UCITS I)
The aim of the original UCITS Directive 85/611/EEC, adopted in 1985, was to allow for
open-ended funds investing in transferable securities to be subject to the same regulation in every
Member State. Under UCITS I, derivatives could only be used for hedging and efficient portfolio
management, that is with the aim of reducing risk or cost, or to replicate a position that could
otherwise be achieved through investing in the underlying asset.

--------------------------------------

Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities (UCITS)
A European Union initiative where UCITS refers to a set
of Directives establishing a harmonized legal framework for the creation,
management and marketing of collective investment schemes in the EU (and EEA) Member
States. There is a long history which is detailed below.

--------------------------------------

Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities II (UCITS II)
In the early 1990s attempts were made to amend the 1985 Directive and more
successfully harmonize laws throughout Europe, since several obstacles become apparent in
following UCITS I. Individual marketing rules in each Member State created obstacles to crossborder
marketing of UCITS. The limited definition of permitted investments for UCITS also
weakened the marketing possibilities of a UCITS. Attempts to reform UCITS in the 1990s
faltered and it was not until the introduction in 2001 of Directive 2001/108/EC (generally known
as the "Product Directive") and Directive 2001/107/EC (generally known as the "Management
Directive") that substantive change was eventually introduced (the Product and Management Directives are UCITS III).

--------------------------------------

Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities III (UCITS III)
A set of Directives adopted in December 2001 which amended UCITS I. UCITS III consists of two directives, a "Product Directive" and a "Management Directive". 
1) Product Directive: Product Directive removes barriers to the cross border marketing of units of collective investment funds by allowing funds to invest in a wider range of financial instruments including derivatives.  
2) Management Directive: Management Directive gives management companies a "European Passport" to operate throughout the EU, which widens the range of activities management companies are allowed to take and also assists the cross-border marketing.
The UCITS III revision gave asset managers a broader scope. At the same
time, the requirements on investor protection were increased and called for an independent risk
management function (to limit/monitor leverage, counterparty risk, concentration limits, etc.).
UCITS III expanded the range of available investments to include derivatives for investment
purposes, other UCITS and cash. This dramatically increased investor choice, allowing for cash
funds, funds of fund, mixed asset funds and absolute return UCITS or UCITS hedge funds. This
has allowed a number of hedge fund strategies to be accommodated within the UCITS format
such as equity long/short, relative value, etc. Some strategies, however, remain difficult to
implement within the UCITS framework because the underlying asset class is not permissible (for
example, individual commodities or bank loans) or because of the lack of liquidity (for example,
distressed debt).

--------------------------------------

Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities IV (UCITS IV)
The proposal of UCITS IV was approved by the European Parliament on January 13, 2009 and also by the Council of European Union, to be implemented in 2011. UCITS IV will bring further uniformity in collective investments throughout European Union. The UCITS IV directive introduced the management company passport and allows a
UCITS to be managed by a management company authorised and supervised in a Member State
other than its home Member State. UCITS IV has increased the governance (“organisational”)
requirements of UCITS Management Companies and funds and has brought these requirements
more in line with the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2004/39/ED (known as MiFID). UCITS or its management company needs to establish independent
compliance and audit functions in addition to the independent risk management which was
already required under UCITS III but which has been expanded to formalise the management of a
variety of risks.

--------------------------------------

Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities V (UCITS V)
The initial draft directive was released in 2012 and UCITS V was adopted by the European Parliament and Council in February 2014. There are three key elements in this proposal:
(1) A new depositary regime which includes a clarification of the depositaries‟ duties,
responsibilities and liabilities and a set of the rules under which responsibilities, such
as sub-custodian roles) can be delegated.
(2) Rules governing remuneration of fund managers including bonus caps.
(3) A sanctions regime.

--------------------------------------

Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities VI (UCITS VI)
The UCITS VI consultation document is in circulation. The EU commission asks respondents whether there
is a need to review the list of eligible assets under UCITS. Other topics in the consultation paper
include efficient portfolio management, OTC derivatives, liquidity management and money
market funds.

--------------------------------------

Undervalued
A stock price perceived to be too low or cheap, as indicated by a particular valuation model. For instance, some might consider a particular company's stock price cheap if the company's price-earnings ratio is much lower than the industry average. To refer to undervaluation or overvaluation implicitly assumes some model of valuation. It is always possible that the security is valued correctly and that model applied is wrong.

--------------------------------------

Underweight
Usually refers to recommendation that leads an investor to reduce their investment in a particular security or asset class. The reduction is usually with respect to a benchmark.

Wrong-way risk
This type of risk occurs when exposure to a counterparty is adversely correlated with the credit quality of that counterparty. There are two types of wrong-way risk. Specific wrong way risk arises through poorly structured transactions, for example, those collateralized by own or related party shares. General or conjectural wrong way risk arises where the credit quality of the counterparty may for non-specific reasons be held to be correlated with a macroeconomic factor which also affects the value of derivatives transactions. An example of conjectural wrong way risk is that fluctuations in the interest rate causes changes in the value of the derivative transactions but could also impact the credit worthiness of the counterparty. Another example might occur with an emerging-market counterparty, where there is country and possibly currency risk associated with the counterparty (however creditworthy it might otherwise be).

Since the issuer buys its own bonds on the open market because of sinking fund requirements, if the bonds are trading below par, this action provides automatic price support for these bonds and they will usually trade on a yield to average life basis.

--------------------------------------

Yield to call
The percentage rate of a bond or note if the investor buys and holds the security until the call date. This yield is valid only if the security is called prior to maturity. Generally bonds are callable over several years and normally are called at a slight premium. The calculation of yield to call is based on coupon rate, length of time to call, and market price.

--------------------------------------

Yield to maturity
The percentage rate of return paid on a bond, note, or other fixed income security if the investor buys and holds it to its maturity date. The calculation for YTM is based on the coupon rate, length of time to maturity, and market price. It assumes that coupon interest paid over the life of the bond will be reinvested at the same rate.
